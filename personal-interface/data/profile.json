      "title": "Senior Finance Manager",
      "company": "Reynolds American Inc.",
      "period": "2023-Present",
      "highlights": [
        "Directed $90M brand P&L with forecasting and long-range planning for Vapor category",
        "Built scenario models for pricing, regulatory, and competitive risk; informed executive investment decisions",
        "Implemented Excel/Power BI reporting automation, reducing close-to-forecast cycle time by 40%",
        "Partnered with Marketing and Sales to optimize spend allocation and achieve double-digit YoY expense savings"
      ],
      "aiContext": "Inherited a complex category where planning quality was constrained by fragmented assumptions across finance, marketing, and sales. Built a unified scenario framework that separated controllable spend levers from external uncertainty (regulatory and competitive). The operational win was less about spreadsheet mechanics and more about forcing cross-functional alignment on assumptions before budget cycles hardened. That shift reduced planning friction and improved decision quality while enabling reporting automation that cut close-to-forecast cycle time by 40%."

        "Implemented new HRIS and transitioned to TriNet PEO, delivering $100K+ overhead savings",

        "Established stronger banking/financing structures including line of credit and fixed loan"
      ],
      "aiContext": "Joined during a turnaround period with intertwined finance, HR, and governance risks. Prioritized survivability first (cash flow, financing, control integrity), then moved to structural redesign (fee strategy, HRIS/PEO transition, banking relationships). The critical pattern was sequencing: stabilize immediate risk, then codify durable systems and ownership. Revenue increased 40%, overhead dropped by over $100K, and the organization gained stronger operating resilience through clearer controls and planning discipline."

The most important value was converting high-complexity analysis into operating decisions, while tightening the consistency of monthly-to-annual planning flows and reducing interpretation drift in management reporting."

Focused on costing governance, variance transparency, and control discipline while translating operational realities into financially usable narratives. The core contribution was reducing the lag between identifying cost/efficiency issues and triggering corrective action through better cadence and cross-functional accountability."
