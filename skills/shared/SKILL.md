# Shared References

This directory contains shared reference documents used by multiple skills:

- `agent-mail-protocol.md` - Message protocol for distributed mode coordination
- `validation-contract.md` - Verification requirements for accepting spawned work

These are **not directly invocable skills**. They are loaded by other skills (crank, swarm, inbox, implement) when needed for distributed mode operation.

## CLI Availability Pattern

All skills that reference external CLIs MUST degrade gracefully when those CLIs are absent.

### Check Pattern

```bash
# Before using any external CLI, check availability
if command -v bd &>/dev/null; then
  # Full behavior with bd
else
  echo "Note: bd CLI not installed. Using plain text tracking."
  # Fallback: use TaskList, plain markdown, or skip
fi
```

### Fallback Table

| CLI | When Missing | Fallback Behavior |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| `bd` | Issue tracking unavailable | Use TaskList for tracking. Note "install bd for persistent issue tracking" |
| `ao` | Knowledge flywheel unavailable | Write learnings to `.agents/knowledge/` directly. Skip flywheel metrics |
| `gt` | Workspace management unavailable | Work in current directory. Skip convoy/sling operations |
| `codex` | Cross-vendor council unavailable | Fall back to Claude-only (already handled by council pre-flight) |
| `cass` | Session search unavailable | Skip transcript search. Note "install cass for session history" |

### Rules

1. **Never crash** — missing CLI = skip or fallback, not error
2. **Always inform** — tell the user what was skipped and how to enable it
3. **Preserve core function** — the skill's primary purpose must still work without optional CLIs
4. **Progressive enhancement** — CLIs add capabilities, their absence removes them cleanly
